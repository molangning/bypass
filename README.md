# Bypass project

A simple redirector hack that should work on Singapore school Ipads that have Mobile Guardian installed.

This is essentially a mobile guardian bypass for school ipads.

THIS WILL ONLY WORK IF THE IPAD SHOWS RESTRICTED SITE ON THE WEBSITE YOU ARE TRYING TO VISIT.

## How do I use it?

Simply open this url in your web browser: [https://bypass--redirect-project.repl.co](https://bypass--redirect-project.repl.co)

## I have found problems in the code/website or I want to suggest something.

If you have found bugs in the code, please feel free to open a issue in the github repo.
For suggestions, make sure you tag them as suggestions in github issues
