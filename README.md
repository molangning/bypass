### Private mirrors

To gain access to private mirrors, get the link from someone you know or send a message to me at emailproxy1423[AT]duck(DoT)com.

### Self hosted mirrors

Self hosting can be done, but the intstructions may be unclear. If it's too unclear just open a new issue and I can try and help you.
Found a new platform to host the platform? Do share it with me through the email if you can.

## Help this project

We need more usage data and users for this project so please share this to your friends.

## About this project

A simple redirector hack that should work on Singapore school iPads that have Mobile Guardian installed.

This redirector will not bypass fortiguard blocks as it does not work by blocking url accesses, but by blocking connections to the website itself.

Examples of the bypass in work

## Tested devices

iPad OS 16.2.1 with mobile guardian installed on Safari 

## How do I use it?

Simply open one of the urls in the [mirrors](https://github.com/molangning/bypass#mirrors) section

Do remember to bookmark this github repository for the newest mirrors

For hosting on replit, follow these instructions: [Self hosting on Replit](https://github.com/molangning/bypass/wiki/Self-hosting-on-replit)

For self hosting, run run.sh in your favourite shell. Currently Linux is supported, but Windows can be used too (with a bit of modifications.)

## Bypass is restricted

Please try all the mirrors first, then hosting on replit. If the issues still persists, open a issue with a screenshot of the resticted page and the name of your school, as the block may just be for your school or countrywide.

## I have found problems in the code/website or I want to suggest something.

If you have found bugs in the code, please feel free to open a issue in the github repo.
For suggestions, make sure you tag them as suggestions in github issues

## TODO
- [x] Hidden links to prevent automatic detection
